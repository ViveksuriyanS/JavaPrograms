Stack is an ADT
It follows FILO or LIFO fashion
 - The element that are inserted at first can be processed at last
 - In other words, the elements inserted at last will be processed First

The Insertion and Deletion of element and all other operations can be done in O(N) time complexity

Can be implemented by 
 - Arrays (Static behavior)
 - Linked List (Dynamic behavior)
 
Operations supported
 - Push -> Insert element at the TOP pointer 
 - Pop  -> Deletes the TOP pointer element
 - Top  -> Returns the TOP element, but don't delete
 - IsEmpty -> Check if the stack is empty
 - IsFull -> Check if the stack is full
