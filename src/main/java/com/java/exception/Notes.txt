A. RunTime Exceptions / Unchecked Exception
 - Will let the code to compile successfully
 - But throw exception while running the compiled code
 - For eg., ArrayIndexOutOfBound exception
   * Runtime Exceptions and all its child classes
   * Error and all its child classes

B. Compile Time Exception / Checked Exception
 - Will not let you to compile successfully
 - For eg., In eclipse, it will show error
 - Programmer can take care of this
   * Except unchecked exceptions all are checked exceptions

- In checked exception, we have two types
   * Fully Checked Exception
     ~ If the parent and all its child classes are checked exception
     ~ Eg., IOException
   * Partially Checked Exception
     ~ If only parent is checked exception and all its children are unchecked exception
     ~ Eg., Exception and Throwable are the only two partially checked exception
