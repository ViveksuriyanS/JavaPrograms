Thread can be suspended for a period of time by using sleep static method
	Thread.sleep(TimeInMilliSecond);
	
Thread can be implemented by two ways
	- Extending Thread Class
	- Implementing Runnable Interface

Note: Implementing Runnable Interface is the most preferable way of implementation, 
	~ The reason being, Java doesn't support Multiple inheritance
	~ Make sure that we also create 2 Object
		* Object of class
		* Thread object
